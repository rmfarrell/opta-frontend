# opta-frontend

Interface for Opta's soccer events api.

Includes pass/shot map with time and team/player filters and stats views

Data comes from Opta's sandbox mode which reflects old data from Bundesliga 2.

All drawing is done with normal HTML. Site includes no images.

## [Demo]

## Update
Opta no longer supports sandbox mode so this uses cached data :(
